## 🗃️ Database Operations
- `CREATE`, `USE`, `DROP` for databases

## 📋 Table Operations
- Table creation with constraints
- Altering table schema (add/modify/rename/drop columns)
- Renaming tables

## 🧮 CRUD Operations
- `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `REPLACE INTO` for insert-or-update logic

## 🔍 Querying Data
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL`
- Sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Aggregations using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Grouping with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Removing duplicates with `DISTINCT`

## 🔗 Foreign Keys & Joins
- Implementing `FOREIGN KEY` with `ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL`

## 🔐 Constraints & Defaults
- `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`

## 🔧 Alterations
- Alter tables with `ADD`, `MODIFY`, `CHANGE`, `DROP`, `RENAME`

## 🧪 Functions & Miscellaneous
- MySQL functions like `UCASE`, `NOW`
- Use of `DUAL` table
